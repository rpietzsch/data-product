- DQV is a standard vocabulary to describe data quality and is proposed along with the DCAT vocabulary to measure the quality of Datasets.
- It is based on 3 basic entities: Dimensions, the Metrics that belong to its dimension, and the Measurement for each Metric.
- Data Quality can be computed in different levels, eg. data product, dataset, table, column level etc. 
- Usually, data quality metrics are measured on a Dataset level and can inform more high level quality metrics on a data product level.
